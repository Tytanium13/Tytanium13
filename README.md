#  Hi, Iâ€™m Tytanium13
## I'm a high-school student and hobbyist developer looking for work in IT. 
### Iâ€™m interested in Python, and have been experimenting with the language since 2018
### I have also been looking at learning C++, Rust, Java, Kotlin, and Golang.

Born and raised in Australia, I have always had big aspirations for myself. I want to work 
in cybersecurity or IT, but I know those are big goals to work towards.

Having aspergus making me fixate on things for months at a time until I burn out, giving little attention to anything else, I've found myself going from being deemed a high-achieving star student to consistently pulling in C's and D's in school.
